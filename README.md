## Spread the Love: Indradhanu’s virtual community art project

Indradhanu is trying to do something similar to the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt. We aim to create a virtual community art project with contributions from all of you. In a time of anxiety related to ‘physical distance’, we hope to bring everyone together and connect virtually through this. :)

## How to organize a similar event: under construction; how to use the code coming soon
